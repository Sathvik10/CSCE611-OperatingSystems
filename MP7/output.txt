Bochs Configuration: Main Menu

This is the Bochs Configuration Interface, where you can describe the

could be found.  When you are satisfied with the configuration, go
ahead and start the simulation.

You can also start bochs with the -q option to skip these menus.

1. Restore factory default configuration

3. Edit options
4. Save options to...
5. Restore the Bochs state from...
6. Begin simulation
